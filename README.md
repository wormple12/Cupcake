# Cupcake

This is an educational project. It was created due to it being a prerequisite to the entrance of an exam.
The project involves a scenario where a firm has tasked programmers to create a website.

The purpose is to gain understanding of:
* The concept of backend and frontend programming.
* Connecting to and using droplets, herein deployment of .war files on a server.
* Retrieval and removal of SQL data on a MySQL database located on a server

Furthermore, the project includes introductions to: HTML, CSS, .jsp sites and more.

## Import notes:

As part of the assignment a Javadoc must be provided for the program. It can be found in the project's github pages:
https://wormple12.github.io/Cupcake/

An example of the deployed .war file can be accessed here:
http://142.93.41.176:8080/Cupcake/

You can host the website yourself by executing the program in your Java IDE, defining and locating the target .war folder and finally deploying it on your server. This is, however, very simplified and you should refer to other sites for more detailed information regarding deployment of .war files if you run into issues. You need to install the following:

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependencies. Necessary.
* [Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) - Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression Language and Java WebSocket technologies

Maven is preinstalled in the Netbeans IDE, which is the IDE that was used in the creation of this project. Other IDEs may not.
